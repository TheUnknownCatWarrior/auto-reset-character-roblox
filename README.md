# auto-reset-character-roblox
A macro to deal with raygun abusers in the Roblox game Survive and Kill the Killers in Area 51 !!! (id = 155382109)
Basically, when your character resets, they do not get any points. 

To run this code you'll need to install Python and some libraries.
Open up the cmd prompt and enter these commands:
pip install pyautogui
pip install keyboard
The program will walk you through how to set up the macro once you run the code. The 'quit' feature is buggy so close the program instead. 

In the future, there may be an EXE version of the code for ease of use.
USE MY CODE AT YOUR OWN RISK as it may be glitchy.
